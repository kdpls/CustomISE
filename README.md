# CustomISE

A PocketMine-MP plugin to change your internal server error kick message.

This plugin was originally planned to be released into Poggit, but then I realized a similar plugin already released in Poggit. Currently there is a chance I will revive/resume the development of this plugin, but it won't be released into Poggit, just like any other plugins in KDPLS.
